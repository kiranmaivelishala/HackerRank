Task 
Write a Person class with an instance variable,age , and a constructor that takes an integer,initialAge , as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge , the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. 
In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
*yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1 .
*amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age<13, print You are young..
If age>=13 and age<18, print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..

public class Person {
    private int age;	
  
	public Person(int initialAge) {
  		// Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge4
        age=initialAge;
        if(age<0)
        {
            age=0;
            System.out.println("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.");
        }
	}

	public void amIOld() {
  		// Write code determining if this person's age is old and print the correct statement:
        if(age>=18)
        System.out.println(/*Insert correct print statement here*/"You are old.");
        if(age<13)
            System.out.println(/*Insert correct print statement here*/"You are young.");
        if(age>=13 && age<18)
            System.out.println(/*Insert correct print statement here*/"You are a teenager.");
	}

	public void yearPasses() {
  		// Increment this person's age.
        age=age+1;
	}
